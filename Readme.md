## Hi there! Please read me for some useful information :)

Firstly, thank you for the opportunity. This has been very challenging, particularly making use of a test library which I have not done before! I've now set myself a goal to become more familiar with TDD going forward.

Anyway, to the good stuff... There are two main scripts to run, one for the output of the two challenges, I would recommend using "npm run dev" . The other is to start the test library to view the test results, the script to run is "npm run test". 

Feel free to do things your way, I just wanted to recommend the way I have been using the repo!

Hope to hear from you soon. Harry ✌️
